# Unity and VR/AR projects

This repo provides access to sample Unity projects. Currently, we focused on Android native API access from Unity; i.e. 
calling/accessing native Android OS components from any Unity app. We performed an investigation of three different techniques 
to achieve native API access. For the future, we are going to upload further projects related to Unity and Augmented/Virtual Reality applications.
